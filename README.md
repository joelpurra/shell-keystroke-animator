# [shell-keystroke-animator](https://github.com/joelpurra/shell-keystroke-animator)

Simulate stroking keyboard keys into another application/window while taking screenshots to create a `.gif` animation.

Create repeatable, editable, automatable example usage of:

- Terminal/shell programs.
- Code snippets.
- Proof-of-concept for hacks.
- Other text input.



## Installation

On Mac with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap joelpurra/joelpurra
brew install shell-keystroke-animator
```

On other systems:

Clone or download, then either use `shell-keystroke-animator/src/keystroke-animator` directly where you put it, or symlink `keystroke-animator`. Required [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 4+ and [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/). Note that `shell-keystroke-animator` is not expected to work on anything but Mac OS X, without modifications.

## Usage

Quickly focus another application/window, where you want your keystrokes to go and animation be created from, as soon as you've started `keystroke-animator`.

Running the software creates a series of `.png` images, and an `output.gif` in the same folder you started it from (`$PWD`).


```bash
cat "my-keys.txt" | keystroke-animator [--no-shadow] [countdown [keysleep [linesleep [endsleep]]]]
```


- `my-keys.txt` Sequence of keys/characters to read from `stdin` and then "type", one by one.
- `--no-shadow` Turn off application window shadows (optional). Useful if the background of the window isn't white.
- `countdown` Pre-script countdown, in integer seconds (optional).
- `keysleep` Time to sleep between keys, in seconds (optional).
- `linesleep` Time to sleep between lines, in seconds (optional).
- `endsleep` Time to sleep at the end of the animation, in seconds (optional).



## Limitations

- Doesn't work great with Terminal commands which take longer than `linesleep` to execute fully.
- The software isn't designed to handle special characters. Only linebreaks (`\n`) are treated differently, and is sent as the <kbd>&crarr;</kbd> (return) key.
- Tested on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite - please add support for any other platforms you like!

## Kudos

- [`ttygif`](https://github.com/icholy/ttygif) and [`ttyrec`](https://github.com/mjording/ttyrec)For inspiration. Shame I couldn't get those programs to work properly.
